 Used to handle complex communications between related objects, helping with decoupling of those objects.

 An airport control tower is an excellent example of the mediator pattern.
 The tower looks after who can take off and land - all communications are done from the airplane to control tower,
 rather than having plane-to-plane communication.
 This idea of a central controller is one of the key aspects to the mediator pattern.
