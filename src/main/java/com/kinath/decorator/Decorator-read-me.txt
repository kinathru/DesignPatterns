The concept of a decorator is that it adds additional attributes to an object dynamically.
A real world example of this would be a picture frame. The picture is our object, which has it's own characteristics.
For display purposes we add a frame to the picture, in order to decorate it.
You're probably already familiar with the concept of wrapper objects, and in essence, that is what a Decorator is.
